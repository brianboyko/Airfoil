This is mostly a placeholder, while I wait for the weekend to work on this in earnest. 

TODO:

  * X container & X tests 
  * X ring & tests
  * X box-shadow & tests
  * filter (but possibly as a function/mixin) & tests
  * backdrop-filter (which will be difficult as neither Edge nor Firefox support backdrop-filter natively) & tests
  * drop-shadow & tests
  * animate-spin & tests
  * animate-ping & tests
  * animate-pulse & tests
  * X screen-reader-only * tests
